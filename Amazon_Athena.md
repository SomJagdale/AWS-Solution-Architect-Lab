Amazon Athena
Primary Function:

Athena: Focuses on querying and analyzing data directly in S3 using SQL.
Glue: Focuses on ETL processes to prepare, transform, and load data.

How They Work Together

Cataloging and Transforming Data: You can use AWS Glue to crawl your data sources, infer schema, and create a centralized data catalog. This metadata catalog can then be queried using Athena.

ETL Pipelines: Use Glue to create ETL pipelines that clean and transform raw data stored in S3. Once processed, this data can be queried and analyzed using Athena.

Data Lake Solutions: Glue helps in building and maintaining data lakes by transforming and cataloging data, which can then be easily queried using Athena.

Both Amazon Athena and AWS Glue are powerful tools for data analytics and processing, but they serve different roles within a data ecosystem. Athena is best suited for users needing to run ad-hoc SQL queries on data stored in S3, while Glue is designed for complex ETL processes and data preparation tasks. Often, these services are used together to create a seamless data processing and analysis workflow on AWS.
